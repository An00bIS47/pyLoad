pyLoad App for Mac

This is a wrapper for pyLoad for Mac, so you have an app in the program directory with all pyload files and an icon which shows if pyload is running.

You have to copy the pyLoad files manually into the following directory

pyLoad.app/Contents/Resources/pyload

If you have any trouble, please post at the following thread:
